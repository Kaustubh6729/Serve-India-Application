We have developed an application using Flutter and Firebase as backend. This project involves two modules - User and 2 Admins. So basically Admins are Fire Department and Pothole Department. 

What User has to do?
Whenever the User realises there is a Fire in his neighbourhood or he / she is disturbed by the potholes, Then he/ she can click the images of that stuff in our application and our Image Classification model built using CNN will classify whether this is the Fire issue or Pothole issue or miscellaneous(i.e a False issue). After classification the complaint would get automatically registered with the concerned department along with the live coordinates of the user, so that the reaction to this disaster would be faster. There will also be the email notifications of the same to respective admins.

What is the role of Admin?
So the 2 admins , will on high priority see the request and push them to further categories such as new requests ,pending requests, in progress requests and  completed requests. So this will help to easily monitor the whole system and user will come to know what is his complaints progress.
